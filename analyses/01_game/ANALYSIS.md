###Time Review
I spent about 50 hours working on this project. I started on 08/25/2015, and finished on 09/03/2015. I spend about an hour planning my project. In the plan phase, I made a list of entities that became classes later. I also had rough sketches of how I want the final design to look. I had description of how entities in the game can interact with each other, but one thing I want to improve in my plan phase is to have methods definition and return values specified at this stage similar to the RPS exercise we did in recitation. I also spend time watching tutorials online and reading the course materials.

After the plan phase, I started coding. I divided the project in three main parts depending on functionality into: Main, level one, and level two. I coded these three main components sequentially starting with Main class. I also spent about four hours debugging issues in my design. I went to office hours for about two hours while I was debugging, and the UTAs were extremely helpful. Not only they helped me fix my errors, but they also suggested ways for me to improve my design and make it easy to follow. 
I also spend about three hours refactoring after 09/01/2015 lecture in accordance with Professor Duvall's instructions

The hardest tasks I had to do were trying to figure out how to change between scenes, how to make the background move continuously, and understanding lambda and keyhandle methods. These tasks required me to spend several hours researching, and trying different code implementation. This is also why I went to office hours.

###Status

* Bullets are made with asterisks

1. You can order things with numbers.

###Design

You can put blocks of code in here like this:
```java
    /**
     * Returns sum of all values in given list.
     */
    public int getTotal (Collection<Integer> data) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int d : data) {
            total += d;
        }
        return total;
    }
```
